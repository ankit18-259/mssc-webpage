      <h2>Facilities of MSSC, AEC</h2>
      <p class="about">Established in 2018, the Multisilling and Sustainabilty Cell (MSSC) of
        <a href="https://aec.ac.in">Assam Engineering College</a> contains various high end hardware
        tools and development environment that a student can use to impart innovations and holistic thinking skills
        apart from academic knowledge in collaboration with C-DAC. Apart form this facilities the cell also holds periodic seminars, hackathons
        and technical sessions. Below are the list of hardware facilities offered by the cell to the students of the college.
